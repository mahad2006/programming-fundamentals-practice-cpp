# Programming Fundamentals Practice â€“ C++

This repository contains my personal C++ practice programs for the **Programming Fundamentals** (PF) course in my first semester of Software Engineering at UBIT.

I'm using this repo to:
- Practice PF topics daily (conditions, loops, logic-building, etc.)
- Keep my code organized for revision later
- Track my progress and consistency

> If anyone else finds this helpful, thatâ€™s a bonus.

## ðŸ“„ Practice Sheet PDF

I created a structured sheet with 60+ problems â€” organized in levels from basic to advanced (conditions, loops, patterns, logic-building, etc.).

ðŸ“¥ [Download the Sheet (PDF)](https://github.com/mahad2006/programming-fundamentals-practice-cpp/blob/main/pf-practice-sheet/PROGRAMMING%20FUNDAMENTALS%20%E2%80%93%20ULTIMATE%20PRACTICE%20SHEET.pdf)

## ðŸ“‚ Folders

- `/pf-practice-sheet`  
  Contains solutions to the complete PF practice sheet I created, organized level-wise.

- `/external-practice` *(optional, for later)*  
  Will include extra problems I solve from YouTube, contests, or books.

## âš¡ Status: In Progress

I'm solving one level at a time from the PF sheet and pushing the code here as I go.
